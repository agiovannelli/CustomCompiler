# CustomCompiler
Custom compiler created during final semester in undergraduate studies.

The goal of the project was to implement a complete, hand-written compiler and the runtime support system. The implementation language was to be selected by the student (Java); with code generation being a synthetic 3-address general register machine language (llvm).

Regex functionality was banned from the project and several additional restrictions were applied, in order to ensure proper exposure to all basic practices in compiler design and development. A custom language syntax was provided, which can be viewed in the testPgms directory.

The code contained in this repository is in progress, with code generation only partially completed. 

Functional Criteria:
  Scanner 
  Parser
  Semantic Analysis
  Code Generation
  Runtime System
